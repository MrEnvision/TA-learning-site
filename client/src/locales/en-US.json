  "parameter-msg-1": "1. Teacher types are divided into smart teacher and normal teacher. The difference between the two is that smart teacher assumes that the internal clock reset can be observed outside, while normal teacher assumes that the system internal clock reset cannot be directly obtained.  For normal teacher, the algorithm need to guess the reset situation, which also greatly increases the complexity of the algorithm.",
  "parameter-msg-2": "2. Equivalence query is divided into exact EQs and PAC testing. The exact EQs is implemented using a decision procedure for language inclusion; the PAC testing is based on the PAC theory through the test to approximate exact EQs. For PAC testing, the algorithm can provide quality assurance based on accuracy and confidence.",
